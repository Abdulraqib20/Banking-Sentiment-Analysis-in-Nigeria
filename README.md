# Banking-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Nigeria

## Description
The aim of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to customer satisfaction with Nigerian banks, in order to gain insights into customer opinions and experiences and identify areas for improvement in the banking industry. By collecting and analyzing tweets mentioning Nigerian banks, we aim to understand the sentiments expressed by customers, whether positive or negative, towards various banking services and experiences. Through natural language processing techniques and the application of XGBoost, Support Vector Machine Classifier models, BERT and KerasNLP , we seek to accurately classify these sentiments and uncover valuable patterns and trends. The findings from this analysis can provide valuable business intelligence to Nigerian banks, enabling them to make data-driven decisions, optimize customer service strategies, and address customer concerns more effectively.

## Key Features
- Introduction: Overview of the project.
- Data Collection: Collected data from Twitter by querying the Twitter API.
- Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the collected data for analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Perform text preprocessing techniques such as removal of URLs, hashtags, mentions and special characters and  tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- Sentiment Scoring: Calculating the sentiment scores and classifying sentiments into two distinct classes (positive and negative).
- Analyzing keywords and phrases used in the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring the data by creating visualizations to understand sentiment distribution and trends in the tweet data.
- Building ML models: Building robust ML models using XGBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predicting sentiments.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using various classification metrics and also accesing it's efficiency and robustness by testing it on new unseen data.
- Text Classification With BERT and KerasNLP: Using BERT, a popular Masked Language Model which is bidirectional (it has access to the words left and right) to build a the text classification model and also KerasNLP, which provides a simple Keras API for training and finetuning NLP models to classify the sentiments.
